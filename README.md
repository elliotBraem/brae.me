# brae.me

My personal website, built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), configured with [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org).
The site features a project page where projects are loaded from markdown files in assets/projects using [frontmatter-markdown-loader](https://github.com/hmsk/frontmatter-markdown-loader).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/elliotBraem/brae.me.git
```
2. Install dependencies
``` bash
$ npm run install
```

## How to use

``` bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000 or http://127.0.0.1:3000
